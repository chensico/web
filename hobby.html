<h4>Job category prediction modeling - Python &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 05/2021-6/2021</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>
          Applied dimension reduction method PCA to simplify 4K features into lower N-dimension and built logistic regression with different N (from 2 to 10) to classify whether the profile is machine learning developer vs web developer, achieved 85% accuracy </li>
        <li>used K-means clustering algorithm to virtualize different classes in the matrix of 37700 *4005</li>
        <li>	Used decision tree to fit the model by using Decision Tree Classifier(python), finding the accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification report</li>
         <li>Used SVM in high dimension (4005 features) dataset to divide web developers and machine learning developers with regularization parameters of 0.01, 0.1,1, and 10, finding the confusion matrix and predicting classification.</li>
          <li>	Compared above model's (K-means clustering, SVM, Decision tree, logistic regression) accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification report to find the best model.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Subscription Prediction for bank telemarketing campaigns  - RStudio &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   11/2020-12/2020</h4>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
              Designed 3 different methods (random forest, logistic regression and SVM) to predict the subscription of a term deposit (41K observations, 20 dimensions) and identified the optimal model based on accuracy & AUC</li>
            <li>Examined correlation plot to show the pairs of variables with high correlation and validated modelâ€™s multi-collinearity</li>
            <li>	Analyzed AUC and ROC to determine the best model to predict the customer who most likely to subscribe to a term deposit and shared target audience with marketing campaigns </li>
             <li> Used Stepwise (a combination of backward selection and forward selection) to identify clients that are more likely to make deposits</li>

          <ol>
            <li>use data mining to clean data </li>
            <li>use pca and different machine method to improve different machine model to improve prediction accuracy</li>
            <li>use graph visualizations show the importance for each variables relating to disease heart </li>
